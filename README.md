# Boss Machine

This repo was created in response to the [CodeCademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) **Off-Platform Project: Boss Machine** challenge project I encountered along the way through the _Full Stack Engineer_ course.

## Project Overview

In this project, you will create an entire API to serve information to a Boss Machine, a unique management application for today’s most accomplished (evil) entrepreneurs. You will create routes to manage your ‘minions’, your brilliant ‘million dollar ideas’, and to handle all the annoying meetings that keep getting added to your busy schedule.
